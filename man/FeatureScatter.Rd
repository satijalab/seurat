}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object}

\item{feature1}{First feature to plot. Typically feature expression but can also
be metrics, PC scores, etc. - anything that can be retreived with FetchData}

\item{feature2}{Second feature to plot.}

\item{cells}{Cells to include on the scatter plot.}

\item{shuffle}{Whether to randomly shuffle the order of points. This can be
useful for crowded plots if points of interest are being buried. (default is FALSE)}

\item{seed}{Sets the seed if randomly shuffling the order of points.}

\item{group.by}{Name of one or more metadata columns to group (color) cells by
(for example, orig.ident); pass 'ident' to group by identity class}

\item{split.by}{A factor in object metadata to split the feature plot by, pass 'ident'
to split by cell identity}

\item{cols}{Colors to use for identity class plotting.}

\item{pt.size}{Size of the points on the plot}

\item{shape.by}{Ignored for now}

\item{span}{Spline span in loess function call, if \code{NULL}, no spline added}

\item{smooth}{Smooth the graph (similar to smoothScatter)}

\item{combine}{Combine plots into a single \code{\link[patchwork]{patchwork}ed}}

\item{slot}{`r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")` soft-deprecated. See `layer`.}

\item{layer}{Layer to pull data from, should be one of 'counts', 'data', or 'scale.data'}

\item{plot.cor}{Display correlation in plot title}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns if plotting multiple plots}

\item{raster}{Convert points to raster format, default is \code{NULL}
which will automatically use raster if the number of points plotted is greater than
100,000}

\item{raster.dpi}{Pixel resolution for rasterized plots, passed to geom_scattermore().
Default is c(512, 512).}

\item{jitter}{Jitter for easier visualization of crowded points (default is FALSE)}

\item{log}{Plot features on the log scale (default is FALSE)}

\value{
A ggplot object

\description{
Creates a scatter plot of two features (typically feature expression), across a
set of single cells. Cells are colored by their identity class. Pearson
correlation between the two features is displayed above the plot.

data("pbmc_small")
