# Seurat v5 beta

Seurat is an R toolkit for single cell genomics, developed and maintained by the Satija Lab at NYGC.

We are excited to release an initial beta version of Seurat v5! This updates introduces new functionality for spatial, multimodal, and scalable single-cell analysis.

Seurat v5 is backwards-compatible with previous versions, so that users will continue to be able to re-run existing workflows. 

As v5 is still in beta, the CRAN installation install.packages("Seurat") will continue to install Seurat v4, but users can opt-in to test Seurat v5 by following the instructions in our [INSTALL PAGE](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/install).

Instructions, documentation, and tutorials can be found at:

* https://satijalab.org/seurat

Seurat is also hosted on GitHub, you can view and clone the repository at

* https://github.com/satijalab/seurat

Seurat has been successfully installed on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows, using the devtools package to install directly from GitHub

Improvements and new features will be added on a regular basis, please post on the [github page](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat) with any questions or if you would like to contribute
