#' Phylogenetic Analysis of Identity Classes
#'
#' Constructs a phylogenetic tree relating the 'aggregate' cell from each
#' identity class. Tree is estimated based on a distance matrix constructed in
#' either gene expression space or PCA space.
#'
#' Note that the tree is calculated for an 'aggregate' cell, so gene expression
#' or PC scores are summed across all cells in an identity class before the
#' tree is constructed.
#'
#' @param object Seurat object
#' @param assay Assay to use for the analysis.
#' @param features Genes to use for the analysis. Default is the set of
#' variable genes (\code{VariableFeatures(object = object)})
#' @param dims If set, tree is calculated in dimension reduction space;
#' overrides \code{features}
#' @param reduction Name of dimension reduction to use. Only used if \code{dims}
#' is not NULL.
#' @param slot `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")` soft-deprecated. See `layer`.
#' @param layer Layer to use.
#' @param graph If graph is passed, build tree based on graph connectivity between
#' clusters; overrides \code{dims} and \code{features}
#' @param reorder Re-order identity classes (factor ordering), according to
#' position on the tree. This groups similar classes together which can be
#' helpful, for example, when drawing violin plots.
#' @param reorder.numeric Re-order identity classes according to position on
#' the tree, assigning a numeric value ('1' is the leftmost node)
#' @param verbose Show progress updates
#'
#' @return A Seurat object where the cluster tree can be accessed with \code{\link{Tool}}
