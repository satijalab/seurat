\usage{
BuildClusterTree(
  object,
  assay = NULL,
  features = NULL,
  dims = NULL,
  reduction = "pca",
  graph = NULL,
  slot = deprecated(),
  layer = "data",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object}

\item{assay}{Assay to use for the analysis.}

\item{features}{Genes to use for the analysis. Default is the set of
variable genes (\code{VariableFeatures(object = object)})}

\item{dims}{If set, tree is calculated in dimension reduction space;
overrides \code{features}}

\item{reduction}{Name of dimension reduction to use. Only used if \code{dims}
is not NULL.}

\item{graph}{If graph is passed, build tree based on graph connectivity between
clusters; overrides \code{dims} and \code{features}}

\item{slot}{`r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")` soft-deprecated. See `layer`.}

\item{layer}{Layer to use.}

\item{reorder}{Re-order identity classes (factor ordering), according to
position on the tree. This groups similar classes together which can be
helpful, for example, when drawing violin plots.}

\item{reorder.numeric}{Re-order identity classes according to position on
the tree, assigning a numeric value ('1' is the leftmost node)}

\item{verbose}{Show progress updates}
}
\value{
A Seurat object where the cluster tree can be accessed with \code{\link{Tool}}
}
\description{
Constructs a phylogenetic tree relating the 'aggregate' cell from each
identity class. Tree is estimated based on a distance matrix constructed in
either gene expression space or PCA space.
}
\details{
Note that the tree is calculated for an 'aggregate' cell, so gene expression
or PC scores are summed across all cells in an identity class before the
tree is constructed.
