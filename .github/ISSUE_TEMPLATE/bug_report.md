<!-- Briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a question, please use the analysis question template instead. -->

<!-- Before posting an issue, ensure that the bug is reproducible by re-running the code that produced the issue in a new R session.-->

<!-- Please include a minimal reproducible code example. You can use the small test data included in Seurat (`pbmc_small`) to demonstrate the issue, or a public dataset (for example, a dataset available through SeuratData https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data). If you cannot reproduce the issue using a public dataset, please still provide code that reproduces the issue on your data and we will try to address it. -->

<!-- Please include the output of `sessionInfo()` and your operating system in your issue. -->
